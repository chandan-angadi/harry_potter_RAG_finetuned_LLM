# README: Fine-Tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model

## Overview
This repository contains an IPython notebook named `rag_w_fine_tuned_modely.ipynb`, which demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. RAG is a powerful architecture that combines retrieval-based techniques with generative capabilities, allowing for dynamic responses that are grounded in an external knowledge base.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this notebook are:
1. **Fine-tune a pre-trained RAG model** using custom datasets to enhance its performance for a specific domain or task.
2. **Incorporate external knowledge sources** (e.g., document databases) into the RAG pipeline for retrieval.
3. **Evaluate the performance** of the fine-tuned model using standard metrics.

## Contents of the Notebook

### 1. **Setup and Initialization**
   - Import necessary libraries and dependencies.
   - Configure environment variables and paths.

### 2. **Dataset Preparation**
   - Load and preprocess the custom dataset.
   - Format the data into the structure required by the RAG model (e.g., question-answer pairs).

### 3. **Model Configuration**
   - Load a pre-trained RAG model.
   - Set up the tokenizer and retriever components.

### 4. **Fine-Tuning**
   - Fine-tune the model using the prepared dataset.
   - Adjust hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs) for optimal performance.

### 5. **Evaluation and Testing**
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model on a test dataset.
   - Compute metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or F1 scores.

### 6. **Inference**
   - Run inference using the fine-tuned model on sample inputs.
   - Demonstrate the modelâ€™s ability to retrieve and generate relevant answers.

### 7. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - Visualize training progress and evaluation results.
   - Analyze the performance of the model and identify areas for improvement.

## Prerequisites

### Libraries and Tools
Ensure the following libraries are installed in your environment:
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- PyTorch
- Datasets (Hugging Face)
- faiss-gpu (for retrieval components)
- Other standard Python libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### Hardware Requirements
- A machine with GPU support is recommended for faster fine-tuning.
- At least 16GB of RAM and 10GB of GPU memory.

## How to Use
1. **Clone this Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
